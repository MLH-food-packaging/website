In the United Kingdom the government recently announced a new law proposal that would introduce tax penalties to companies using single-use plastics. As a UK based company it is our duty to give aid to businesses affected by this law and help them in their transition to recycled and sustainable products.

If you or your company is affected, be sure to reach out to us!
